<p style="font-family:Comic Sans Ms; color:#854442; font-size:18px""> Well...in a nutshell, I am a person who is interested in a huge variety of things.
 I enjoy developing personally and enriching my so-called "identity capital".
 <br>I believe that it is important to keep developing as a human-being and to learn new skills together with acquiring better habits while ageing.
 <br>That is why I have tried many different kinds of activities in my life; starting from playing the musical instrument and singing and ending with learning HTML and CSS.
 <br>I believe in the value of family and community building that's why inter cultural communication is one of my most favourite things to practice.
  <br>I really love the journey of life and feel excited about the coming new experiences which are waiting for me. :)
